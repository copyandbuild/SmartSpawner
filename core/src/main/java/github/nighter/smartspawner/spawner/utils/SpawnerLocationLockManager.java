 * Centralized manager for location-based locks to prevent race conditions
 * when multiple operations (GUI destack, pickaxe break, etc.) affect the same spawner.
 *
 * This prevents duplication exploits where players could:
 * - Click GUI to remove spawners while breaking with pickaxe
 * - Have multiple players break the same spawner in the same tick
 * - Trigger simultaneous operations that modify stack size
 *
 * Thread-safe and memory-efficient with automatic cleanup.
